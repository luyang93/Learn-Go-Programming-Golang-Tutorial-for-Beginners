# Primitives

- Boolean type
    - Values are true or false
    - Not an alias for other types(e.g. int)
    - Zero value is false
- Numeric types
    - Integers
        - Signed integers
            - int type has varying size, but min 32 bits
            - 8 bit(int8) through 64 bit(int64)
        - Unsigned integers
            - 8 bit(byte and uint8) through 32 bit(uint32)
        - Arithmetic operations
            - Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, remainder
        - Bitwise operations
            - And, or, xor, and not
        - Zero value is 0
        - Can't mix types in same family!(uint16 + uint32 = error)
    - Floating point
        - Follow IEEE-754 standard
        - Zero value is 0
        - 32 and 64 bit versions
        - Literal styles
            - Decimal(3.14)
            - Exponential(13e18 or 2E10)
            - Mixed(13.7e12)
        - Arithmetic operations
            - Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
    - Complex numbers
        - Zero value is (0 + 0i)
        - 64 and 128 bit versions
        - Built-in functions
            - complex - make complex number from two floats
            - real - get real part as float
            - imag - get imaginary as float
        - Arithmetic operations
            - Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Text types
    - Strings
        - UTF-8
        - Immutable
        - Can be concatenated with plus(+) operator
        - Can be converted to []byte
    - Rune
        - UTF-32
        - Alias for int32
        - Special methods normally required to process
            - e.g. strings.Reader#ReadRune
