# Pointers

- Creating pointers
    - Pointer types use an asterisk(*) as a prefix to type pointed to
        - *int - a pointer to an integer
    - Use the addressof operator(&) to get addressof variable
- Dereferencing pointers
    - Dereferencing a pointer by preceding with an asterisk(*)
    - Complex types(e.g. struct) are automatically dereferenced
- Create pointers to objects
    - Can use the addressof operator(&) if value type already exists
        - ms := myStruct{foo: 42}
        - p := &ms
    - Use addressof operator before initializer
        - &myStruct{foo: 42}
    - Use the new keyword
        - Cant initialize fields at the same time
- The new function
- Working with **nil**
- Types with internal pointers
    - All assignment operations in Go are copy operations
    - Slices and maps contain internal pointers, so copies point to same underlying data
